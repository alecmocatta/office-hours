# September dates

## Instructions

Find a slot that says "unassigned" and seems suitable. Edit the file
to include your name and whatever details you care to give about your
problem -- if you can include a twitter handle or some other means of
contacting you, that'd be great, since sometimes I may have to cancel
last minute. Open a PR.
